# Implementation Plan: Rate Limiting API

This document outlines a step-by-step plan for implementing the Rate Limiting API described in the PRD. The plan is divided into progressive milestones to help organize and track development.

---

## Milestone 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure
- Set up project repository and directory structure.
- Define initial API skeleton (endpoints, request/response models).
- Set up basic logging and configuration management.
- Implement input validation utilities.
- Write initial unit tests for input validation and configuration loading.

## Milestone 2: In-Memory Rate Limiting (Single Node)
- Implement the Token Bucket algorithm (preferred), plus stubs for Fixed Window and Sliding Window.
- Support per-user, per-IP, and per-API key configuration.
- Implement thread-safe in-memory storage for counters/state.
- Integrate rate limit checks into the API endpoints.
- Return correct status codes and headers (`200 OK`, `429 Too Many Requests`, rate limit headers).
- Log all limit breaches and suspicious activity using structured logging.
- Write unit and integration tests for in-memory mode.

## Milestone 3: Distributed Rate Limiting (Multi-Node)
- Integrate Redis (or similar) for distributed state management.
- Implement atomic operations for counters (INCR, EXPIRE, Lua scripts as needed).
- Support configuration for fail open/closed on backend failure.
- Handle clock skew and resource leak prevention (e.g., Redis key expiration).
- Write integration tests for distributed mode.

## Milestone 4: Configuration & Extensibility
- Implement endpoints to retrieve and update rate limit configuration (`GET`/`POST /rate_limit/config`).
- Add support for global and endpoint-specific limits.
- Add support for whitelisting trusted users/services.
- Make it easy to add new algorithms or limit types (extensible design).
- Write tests for configuration management and extensibility features.

## Milestone 5: Metrics, Monitoring & Error Handling
- Track and expose metrics (allowed/blocked requests, breaches, latency) via Prometheus or similar.
- Implement alerting for high breach rates or system errors.
- Ensure clear error messages and headers on limit breach.
- Handle backend failures gracefully and log all errors.
- Write tests for metrics and error handling.

## Milestone 6: Security & Finalization
- Review and enhance input validation and security (prevent header spoofing, no sensitive data in logs).
- Conduct code review for thread safety, resource management, and logging consistency.
- Document all endpoints, configuration options, and logging/metrics formats.
- Prepare deployment and scaling documentation.
- Final round of testing (unit, integration, edge cases).

## Notes & Best Practices
- Prioritize secure coding and input validation at every step.
- Use structured logging as specified in the PRD.
- Write clear, maintainable code with comments where helpful.
- Address edge cases (clock skew, backend unavailability, resource leaks) as you progress.
- Review and update this plan as requirements evolve.
